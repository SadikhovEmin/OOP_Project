# OOP_Project

This project can be used by both the restaurant 
customers and the restaurant manager. Customers can use the 
application to give their orders. Furthermore, the
restaurant manager can use the application to follow the restaurant's 
expenses and revenues. The manager can also display the employees
or add more employees. An example user interface for this restaurant application is 
presented below.

### Order Creation :
When customer wants to create an order, as the first thing, the system randomly assigns
a waiter to the customer. A pop-up message will be displayed with the name of the waiter 
who is assigned randomly. After closing the pop-up the following view is displayed 
to the user.

User can select any individual product or menu product from the combobox menu. Whenever
a product is selected, the price of the product is displayed next to the
Price label. For example, in the following screenshots, 6.00 TL is displayed 
for the price of the Pizza and 3.00 TL is displayed for Ice Cream.

When user clicks the “Finalize” button, the order will be created and added to
the orders list of the waiter. At the same time a pop up with the total price of 
the order will be displayed to the user. And then after user clicks “OK” button, the
app will go to its initial state and continue from there.
